## MA in Geography and Urban Studies
Graduate students in Geography and Urban Studies emphasize research in environmental issues, gender and race, geographic methods, international development, social and spatial theory and urban development. The MA degree is designed to prepare students for further graduate study as well as for professional positions related to urban and economic development, environmental sustainability and social justice. Students in the MA have the option to pursue a Graduate Certificate in GIS with no additional coursework.

## PhD in Geography and Urban Studies
We offer an integrative doctoral program in geography and urban studies that gives students a strong analytical foundation and stresses spatial relations, scale transitions, place and context and societal relations. Graduates of our PhD program in Geography and Urban Studies are prepared for faculty positions in a range of academic disciplines; they work in programs and departments that range from traditional geography to more interdisciplinary ones like development studies and urban planning. They also work in NGOs, private sector firms and think tanks that deal with relevant issues.

We place emphasis on the following issues:
- **Globalization**: Capital and labor flows, welfare state restructuring, identity, culture and concepts of citizenship
- **Social Justice**: Increasing inequalities in terms of economics, gender and inequalities
- **Sustainability**: Urban ecology, environmental justice, land use and sprawled development patterns
- **Geographic Methods**: Spatial analysis, remote sensing, qualitative research

## PSM in GIS
GIS is one of the 10 most employable skills of 2017 on [LinkedIn](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/2017s-most-in-demand-skills-according-to-linkedin?utm_content=buffer23af8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer), and the [U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.doleta.gov/brg/indprof/geospatial_profile.cfm) estimates that the geospatial technology market is growing at an annual rate of 35 percent. Full-time students can complete our Professional Science Master’s (PSM) degree in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in as soon as a year. This means you can return or enter the workforce quickly. We produce competitive and skilled GIS technicians who easily pass the GISP certification exam. We are affiliated with the National Professional Science Master’s Association and work with an advisory board of professionals in the field ensures that we teach the skills employers seek.
