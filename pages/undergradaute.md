### Major in Geography and Urban Studies
Geography and Urban Studies majors study a wide range of environmental, economic, social and political challenges that are central to the well-being of billions of people in an urbanizing world. The four research themes associated with the department are Social Justice, Globalization, Sustainability, and Geographic Methods. These are increasingly central issues to understanding and addressing global challenges. Geography and Urban Studies students are introduced to urban processes, spatial relations, geospatial technologies, including GIS. In addition, you'll learn qualitative and quantitative social science research methods.

### Double Major with the College of Education

### Undergraduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems
GIS is anything that combines data with maps. Because it is so widely applicable, geographic information has become one of the linchpins of the Information Age. Geospatial technology is considered a high-growth industry by the U.S. Department of Labor and employers are seeking candidates trained in geospatial technologies. Geographic information has become one of the lynchpins of the Information Age. A GIS certificate will give you the skills you need to take on advanced research positions in technology-based companies, governmental agencies and non-profit organizations.

### Independent Study
Independent studies courses allow students the opportunity to work with an individual professor to take on advanced study in the major. Typically students take independent studies as juniors or seniors after they have completed the majority of the requirements for the major. Students need to find a professor who is willing to sponsor the independent study, and most professors will only work with students they know and share some interest.

### Financial Aid and Scholarships
If you need help paying for college, you aren’t alone. Most college students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University uses to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans. Filling out the FAFSA often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance. Learn more about getting financial aid at the Student Financial Services. Our department also rewards undergraduate students with outstanding academic records with cash awards.
