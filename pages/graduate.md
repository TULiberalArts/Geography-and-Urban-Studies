### Earn an MA or PhD in Geography and Urban Studies
Our MA and PhD programs focus on the themes of globalization, sustainability and social justice - three central areas to understanding and tackling the real-world conditions of an increasingly urbanized world. The complexity of human-environment interactions, as well as the interconnectedness of the global economy have fueled a resurgence of geographic theory and methods as a framework for analyzing metropolitan and urban conditions. Temple's graduate programs in GUS draw on our Philadelphia location to provide students with opportunities to engage in public policy and urban research. 

In recent years, members of the department have published a half dozen books with leading publishers including Oxford University Press, MIT Press, and Wiley and Routledge. We've contributed articles to leading journals like the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Environment and Planning A, and the Journal of Urban Affairs. In addition, our programs have won competitive grants from the World Bank, the Environmental Protection Agency, the United Nations, the National Science Foundation, and more. Our programs are affiliated with the Association of American Geographers and the Urban Affairs Association.

### MA in Geography and Urban Studies
Graduate students in Geography and Urban Studies emphasize research in environmental issues, gender and race, geographic methods, international development, social and spatial theory and urban development. The MA degree is designed to prepare students for further graduate study as well as for professional positions related to urban and economic development, environmental sustainability and social justice. Many of our graduates continue their education by pursuing doctoral degrees in some of the nation's most prestigious PhD programs. Others find employment in public agencies and private sector firms sector agencies that deal with environmental planning, land use and urban problems.

## PhD in Geography and Urban Studies
Graduates of our PhD program in Geography and Urban Studies are prepared for faculty positions in a range of academic disciplines; they work in programs and departments that range from traditional geography to more interdisciplinary ones like development studies and urban planning. They also are prepared for employment outside of academia, including NGOs and think tanks that deal with relevant issues. Our faculty members hold doctoral degrees in a half dozen different social sciences. Beyond the interdisciplinary expertise of the Department of Geography and Urban Studies, our program draws on the expertise of faculty in related programs across Temple University. 

Emphasis is placed on the development of research techniques and analytical skills applicable to problem solving. We place emphasis on the following issues:

- **Globalization:** Capital and labor flows, welfare state restructuring, identity, culture and concepts of citizenship.
- **Social Justice:** Increasing inequalities in terms of economics, gender and inequalities.
- **Sustainability:** Urban ecology, environmental justice, land use and sprawled development patterns.
