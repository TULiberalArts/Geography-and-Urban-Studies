## Major in Geography and Urban Studies

Our [major in geography and urban studies](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/geography-urban-studies/ba-geography-urban-studies/) combines the analytical frameworks of the discipline of geography with the study of urbanization and environment in both U.S. and international settings. Gateway courses help students develop an understanding of geographical principles and bases of knowledge, allowing them to then cultivate their specific interests through a series of upper level electives. Within this framework, students can choose courses that focus on human geography, multi-method approaches to urban problems, spatial approaches to human-environment relations, and methods of spatial analysis and geovisualization.

### Curriculum

Students majoring in geography and urban studies are equipped with the intellectual and methodological tools necessary to understand and address a wide range of environmental, economic, social and political challenges that are central to the well-being of billions of people around the globe in an urbanizing world. The courses for the GUS major focus on the themes of globalization, sustainability and social justice, all increasingly central to understanding these sorts of challenges and opportunities. Geographic methodology and analytical approaches constitute a fourth theme, and oftentimes unifying and illuminating overlaps among the other three.

The GUS major requires students to complete a total of 39 credits, including two gateway courses, four methods courses, one international course, five elective courses and one capstone course.

GUS students will acquire an understanding in the following areas:

- How space, place and scale shape the interaction between environment and society
- Critical thinking skills developed through examining a range of analytical approaches to investigate geographic, urban and environmental processes
- Contemporary explanatory frameworks in both geography and urban studies such as political ecology, feminist and poststructuralist theory, and development theory
- The application of information technology skills such as geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial statistics to analyze spatial and temporal information, processes and patterns through integrative research experiences
- Practical considerations of community and environmental organizational settings at the local and regional scales.

Many students choose GUS as a major in their second year after taking an introductory course in the field. As we are a small department, we are able to offer our students accurate, timely and friendly academic advice. Majors can be assigned to a faculty mentor in their area of specialization.

### Focus Areas

Within this department, you may select courses in four general areas: Social Justice, Globalization, Sustainability, and Geographic Methods. See our [research](https://develop.cla.temple.edu/geography-and-urban-studies/research/) page for more information on these areas. It is also possible to incorporate courses from other departments. For more information on courses, see the [Undergraduate Courses] (http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/geography-urban-studies/#courseinventory) page or the [Undergraduate Bulletin](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/geography-urban-studies/).

### Double Major with the College of Education
Students may elect to earn certification in secondary school social studies by combining a major in geography and urban studies with a major in social studies education. Students may also earn certification through a GUS major and education minor following the 5-year BA/MA program.

## Minor in 
Our [minor in geography and urban studies](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/geography-urban-studies/minor-geography-urban-studies/) is available to any student enrolled at Temple University. Many students choose to add a GUS minor as a complement to their program of study. This is an 18-credit minor, requiring students to take one gateway course and five electives.

## Undergraduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems
Geographic information has become one of the lynchpins of the Information Age. The [undergraduate certificate in GIS](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/geography-urban-studies/certificate-geographic-information-systems/) will give you the skills you need to take on advanced research positions in technology-based companies, governmental agencies, and non-profit organizations.

### What is Geographic Information Systems (GIS)?
GIS is anything that combines data with maps. Because it is so widely applicable, geographic information has become one of the linchpins of the Information Age. Geospatial technology is considered a high-growth industry by the U.S. Department of Labor and employers are seeking candidates trained in geospatial technologies. Its uses are so pervasive in modern industry that the market is growing at an annual rate of almost 35 percent, with faster than average job growth expected over the next ten years.

Training in GIS will give you the skills you need to take on advanced research positions in technology-based companies, governmental agencies and non-profit organizations. A variety of industries hire people with this important skill set, including public health, the environment, business, technology, city planning, education, design, criminal justice, sociology, communications, journalism and engineering.

**This certificate is open to students in all majors across all colleges and schools at Temple University**.

### Financial Aid and Scholarships
If you need help paying for college, you aren’t alone. Most college students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University uses to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans. Filling out the FAFSA often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance. Learn more about getting financial aid at the Student Financial Services.
