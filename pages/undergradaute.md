## Major in Geography and Urban Studies

Geography and Urban Studies majors study a wide range of environmental, economic, social and political challenges that are central to the well-being of billions of people in an urbanizing world. The four research themes associated with the department are Social Justice, Globalization, Sustainability, and Geographic Methods. These are increasingly central issues to understanding and addressing global challenges. Geography and Urban Studies students are introduced to urban processes, spatial relations, geospatial technologies, including GIS, and qualitative and quantitative social science research methods.

If you major in GUS, you'll acquire an understanding of the following areas:

- How space, place and scale shape the interaction between environment and society
- Critical thinking skills developed through examining a range of analytical approaches to investigate geographic, urban and environmental processes
- Contemporary explanatory frameworks in both geography and urban studies such as political ecology, feminist and poststructuralist theory, and development theory
- The application of information technology skills such as geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial statistics to analyze spatial and temporal information, processes and patterns through integrative research experiences
- Practical considerations of community and environmental organizational settings at the local and regional scales.

### Double Major with the College of Education
You may choose to earn a certification in secondary school social studies by combining a major in geography and urban studies with a major in social studies education. Students may also earn certification through a GUS major and education minor following the 5-year BA/MA program.

## Undergraduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems
Geographic information has become one of the lynchpins of the Information Age. The [undergraduate certificate in GIS](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/geography-urban-studies/certificate-geographic-information-systems/) will give you the skills you need to take on advanced research positions in technology-based companies, governmental agencies, and non-profit organizations.

**This certificate is open to students in all majors across all colleges and schools at Temple University**.

### Independent Study

Independent studies courses allow students the opportunity to work with an individual professor to take on advanced study in the major. Typically students take independent studies as juniors or seniors after they have completed the majority of the requirements for the major. Students need to find a professor who is willing to sponsor the independent study, and most professors will only work with students they know and share some interest.

### Financial Aid and Scholarships
If you need help paying for college, you aren’t alone. Most college students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University uses to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans. Filling out the FAFSA often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance. Learn more about getting financial aid at the Student Financial Services.
