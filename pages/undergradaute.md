## Major in Geography and Urban Studies
Geography and urban studies majors study a wide range of environmental, economic, social and political challenges central to the well-being of billions of people in an urbanizing world. GUS students are introduced to urban processes, spatial relations, geospatial technologies–including Geographic Information Systems (GIS)–and qualitative social science research methods. These skills prepare students to solve real-world urban problems and address global challenges.

## Undergraduate Certificate in GIS
GIS is powerful analytical software that combines data with maps. It allows users to query, analyze and visualize spatial data, asking any “where” questions: “where are we seeing outbreaks of flu,” “where will this utility have the greatest impact” or “where should we open our storefront?” 

Because it is so widely applicable, geographic information has become one of the linchpins of the Information Age. Employers across industries are seeking candidates trained in geospatial technologies. Because its uses are so pervasive, the U.S. Department of Labor considers geospatial technology a high-growth industry. It’s growing at an [annual rate of almost 35 percent](https://www.doleta.gov/brg/indprof/geospatial_profile.cfm), with faster-than-average job growth expected over the next 10 years. 

The geographic information systems certificate is open to students in all majors across all colleges and schools at Temple University.

## Accelerated Degree Offerings (4+1)
The department’s 4+1 programs allow students to start pursuing a graduate degree in their junior or senior year, empowering them to complete their graduate degree in only one additional year. Students may enter the 4+1 program in their junior or senior year, taking up to four graduate-level courses during their undergraduate program. The remaining graduate credits are completed in the year following the completion of their bachelor’s degree. Graduate-level courses completed during the junior or senior year may be used to satisfy major requirements, as appropriate.

The 4+1 program allows students to begin pursuing a graduate degree in a high-growth area while still working toward an undergraduate degree, saving them time and money in earning their graduate degree.
