### Earn an MA or PhD in Geography and Urban Studies
Our MA and PhD programs focus on the themes of globalization, sustainability and social justice - three central areas to understanding and tackling the real-world conditions of an increasingly urbanized world. Temple's graduate programs in GUS draw on our Philadelphia location to provide students with opportunities to engage in public policy and urban research. Our faculty members hold doctoral degrees in a half dozen different social sciences. Beyond the interdisciplinary expertise of the Department of Geography and Urban Studies, our program draws on the expertise of faculty in related programs across Temple University. 

In recent years, members of the department have published a half dozen books with leading publishers including Oxford University Press, MIT Press, and Wiley and Routledge. We've contributed articles to leading journals like the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Environment and Planning A and the Journal of Urban Affairs. In addition, our programs have won competitive grants from the World Bank, the Environmental Protection Agency, the United Nations, the National Science Foundation, and more. Our programs are affiliated with the Association of American Geographers and the Urban Affairs Association. 

### MA in Geography and Urban Studies
Graduate students in Geography and Urban Studies emphasize research in environmental issues, gender and race, geographic methods, international development, social and spatial theory and urban development. The MA degree is designed to prepare students for further graduate study as well as for professional positions related to urban and economic development, environmental sustainability and social justice.

### PhD in Geography and Urban Studies
We offer an integrative doctoral program in geography and urban studies that gives students a strong analytical foundation and stresses spatial relations, scale transitions, place and context and societal relations. Graduates of our PhD program in Geography and Urban Studies are prepared for faculty positions in a range of academic disciplines; they work in programs and departments that range from traditional geography to more interdisciplinary ones like development studies and urban planning. They also work in NGOs, private sector firms and think tanks that deal with relevant issues. 

We place emphasis on the following issues: 

- **Globalization:** Capital and labor flows, welfare state restructuring, identity, culture and concepts of citizenship.
- **Social Justice:** Increasing inequalities in terms of economics, gender and inequalities.
- **Sustainability:** Urban ecology, environmental justice, land use and sprawled development patterns.

### PSM in GIS
GIS is included amongst the 10 most employable skills of 2017 on LinkedIn, and the U.S. Department of Labor estimates that the geospatial technology market is growing at an annual rate of 35 percent. Full-time students can complete our Professional Science Master’s (PSM) degree in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in as short as a year. This means you can return or enter the workforce quickly. We produce competitive and skilled GIS technicians who pass the GISP certification exam. We are affiliated with the National Professional Science Master’s Association and work with an advisory board of professionals in the field to ensure that we teach the skills employers seek.

### Graduate Certificate in GIS
We offer a Graduate Certificate for students who already have a BA and want to pursue additional coursework in GIS. Our courses introduce students to a variety of cutting-edge spatial analysis technology and mapping software. The certificate complements our Professional Science Master’s in GIS and serves as a gateway into the program. It also augments graduate programs in the College of Liberal Arts and throughout Temple University.

### Academic Advising
As a student working toward your MA or PhD, you’ll be guided toward a concentration based on your interests and the available resources at the department. The Graduate Director assigns each incoming graduate student to an initial advisor, based on area of interest. As a graduate student, you are evaluated in an annual review process, and also at the end-of-the-first-semester to make sure you are making good progress. Currently, the department’s Graduate Director is Professor Hamil Pearsall, who can be contacted at [hamil.pearsall@temple.edu](mailto:hamil.pearsall@temple.edu). 

### Internships and Professional Development
We work closely with our students to ensure they have a rich experience beyond the classroom, enhancing academic work with internships and experiential learning opportunities. We help graduate students find internships at planning and social service agencies and firms that specialize in mapping and geographic data analysis. Internships are complemented by an seminar in which you discuss your experience. Currently, our internship coordinator is [Dr. Max Andrucki](mailto:max.andrucki@temple.edu).

### Funding for Graduate School
Graduate students are eligible for financial assistance from federal, state, private and Temple University sources. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University uses to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans. Filling out the FAFSA often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance. We also provide financial support to full-time students doctoral students through a variety of university and departmental teaching and research assistantships, fellowships and awards. Most assistantships and fellowships carry a stipend plus a tuition waiver.
