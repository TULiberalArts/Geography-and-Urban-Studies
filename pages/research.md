## Research Projects

Faculty research projects focus broadly on the interconnections among processes of globalization, the implications for sustainability, and the impact on equity and social justice. These research emphases incorporate a strong analytical foundation of both quantitative and qualitative geographic methods, as well as urban policy.

Sponsored research projects in the department are funded by a variety of federal and international agencies and foundations, including the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Justice, the National Institutes of Health, The World Bank and the William Penn Foundation, among others. Through these resources, graduate students play an integral role in sponsored research.

Browse the information below to read more about specific faculty members and research projects associated with the department’s research foci.

## Focus Areas

We train our students to conduct theoretically-informed and empirically-grounded research in metropolitan and rural settings (US and international), understand interdisciplinary and integrative analyses of complex urban processes and problems, and specialize in techniques for urban analysis with an emphasis on GIS, spatial statistics or qualitative methods. We draw upon our Philadelphia location to provide students with the opportunity to engage in public policy and applied urban research. Furthermore, students can utilize our faculty’s linkages with public agencies, educational institutions, community-based organizations, non-governmental organizations and social movements in our region, many other regions in the US and several significant international locations.

Our specific research foci include four main areas. Click on one to jump to that section.

- [Globalization](#globalization)
- [Sustainability](#sustainability)
- [Geographic Methods](#geographic-methods)

## Social Justice 

We are interested in how globalization affects local and regional development and how it contributes to changing economic, social and environmental inequalities both between and within places, with different populations having different life chances depending on their social and geographic location. Our research focuses on the intersection of place and inequality (including gender, race/ethnicity and economic inequalities) both within and between US and international contexts, individual and collective action for equity, and the actors and the process of policy making at multiple scales.

### Research Projects

**Inequality among Metropolitan Communities (Carolyn Adams and David Bartelt)**

From 2003 to 2012, Professors Adams and Bartelt, along with colleagues from Sociology and Political Science, collected, organized and mapped hundreds of social, environmental and economic indicators to analyze trends in the quality of life in the greater Philadelphia region. Funded by over $2 million from the William Penn Foundation, that project has documented unequal access in different communities to employment, public services, education, mortgage lending and many other dimensions of community life. It has served as a source of data for both faculty publications and recent dissertations.

**Monsters over Kyiv (Roman Cybriwsky)**

Kyiv, the capital of Ukraine, is an historic city that was built originally for reasons of defense on high bluffs overlooking the River Dnipro. Beautiful golden-domed churches and monasteries were also built on the hilltops, earning the city the nickname “New Jerusalem” during its heyday in the Middle Ages. Some of those churches have survived the centuries and are icons of history. The bluffs are also noted for parkland and a broad range of monuments from the Czarist Russian Empire, the Soviet decades, and the time since Ukrainian independence in 1991. This scene shows recent illegal construction of high-end apartments for the rich and politically connected on illegally seized parkland overlooking the Dnipro. Ukrainians call such buildings “monsters” because they are uninvited, take land from the common good, violate city planning objectives, and wreak havoc with historic fabric and natural environment. The iconic landscape of historic Kyiv is being destroyed by this type of ill-advised high-rising in a climate of government corruption and a rush for profits.

**Digital Divides and Urban Inequalities (Melissa R. Gilbert)**

This research examines the intersection of inequalities in access to information and communication technologies (ICTs) and economic inequalities using Philadelphia as a case study. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis of primary and secondary data, this research seeks to understand the relationships among technological and social capital embedded in particular neighborhoods, occupational sex and race segregation, local labor markets, and access to and use of ICTs and related information flows in areas important to people such as jobs, education, and political participation. By understanding the relationships among gendered, racialized and place inequalities in terms of access to ICTs and economic empowerment, this research will contribute to policy discussions about how to empower people living in poverty.

**Food, Bodies and Land (Allison Hayes-Conroy)**

GUS faculty member Allison Hayes-Conroy has developed four different projects related to social justice. Working on food adequacy among displaced women in Medellin, Colombia she and Temple colleague Betsy Sweet have tried to understand how rural families whose lives have been severely impacted by violence experience the urban food systems that they are forced into. In a related project on Medellin’s Legion del Afecto movement, Hayes-Conroy has also sought to understand how violence-impacted communities have overcome fear and marginalization through the formation of unlikely bonds using song, dance, theatre, food and collective journey. Back in Philadelphia, Hayes-Conroy’s work on Critical Nutrition seeks to understand practices of nourishment that are not dictated by nutrition but rather begin through assessments of cultural strengths and social inequities. Finally, elsewhere in Colombia she and colleagues have formed a research interest group on the social, health and environmental effects of herbicide release for coca eradication. Several Temple undergraduate and graduate students have been involved in these projects.

**Environmental Justice (Jeremy Mennis)**

Environmental justice is the principle that all people have equal protection under environmental laws and the right to participate in environmental decision-making in their community. I am interested in the quantitative analysis of race, class, and other socioeconomic characteristics as they relate to indicators of environmental risk, particularly toxins produced from industrial and commercial activity. Recent research has focused on the distribution of air toxic releases in New Jersey, as well as on racial equity in actions taken by agencies responsible for enforcing environmental policies.

**Cities, Photography and Critical Pedagogy (Rickie Sanders)**

My interests center on the connections between social theory and the social, cultural and visual tendencies of society. I am particularly interested in how interactions and desires ground themselves on the landscape. My recent work has included an examination of invisibility on the urban landscape (with Loreley Garcia Gomez), the work of Italo Calvino, the public space of urban communities, and the complexities of connecting critical geography to the classroom. I am presently working on a book length monograph in collaboration with Bogdan Jankowski which explores how cities and urban landscapes are imagined and re-presented.

**Transport Methods of Resistance Movements (Jacob Shell)**

This project looks at the social geographies of transportation during resistance movements.  What modes of transportation, and what transport-oriented labor niches, have been understood as especially useful for clandestine, politically subversive mobility, in different times and places over the past 150 years?  My main case-studies look at the U.S. and Canada, the British Isles, and South and Southeast Asia. In undertaking this research, I became especially interested in the cultural politics and contested geographic manifestations of animal-based and water-based forms of transportation.  This research has culminated in a book which is forthcoming from MIT Press.

## Globalization

We are interested in studying the diverse processes that constitute globalization and their impacts on urban conditions and people’s daily lives in cities in both US and international contexts. Our interest is in the urban and regional dimensions of these changes: in capital flows, labor markets, labor flows, immigration, and welfare state restructuring; identity, culture, and concepts of citizenship; and social and cultural processes in domestic and international settings.

### Research Projects

**Persistence of Inequality and the Distribution of Income and Industry (Sanjoy Chakravorty)**

This ongoing research examines the spatial and social distribution of income and industry and approaches broader theoretical questions of the persistence of inequality. The empirical results have been reported in two recent books: _Fragments of Inequality: Social, Spatial, and Evolutionary Analyses of Income Distribution_ (2006, London, Routledge) and _Made in India: The Economic Geography and Political Economy of Industrialization_ (2007, Oxford University Press). This research has been funded by several institutions, including The National Science Foundation, The World Bank, and The American Institute of Indian Studies.

**Tokyo’s Roppongi: Conflicts of Space and Society in a Global Nightclub District (Roman Cybriwsky)**

A recent book, _Roppongi Crossing: Demise of a Tokyo Nightclub District and the Reshaping of a Global City_, is an ethnographic account of a famous international nightclub district under siege by Tokyo officialdom and powerful developers who are remaking the area into one of upscale shopping malls, soaring office towers, international hotels, and new museums, concerts venues, and other cultural attractions. As a result, the nightclub district is on its last dance.  Over the decades since the US Occupation of Japan after World War II through the country’s rise to global economic prominence in the latter 20th century, Roppongi had been a critical venue for internationalization in Japan, and mixing between Japanese party-goers and Tokyo’s foreign residents and short-term visitors. The district thrived especially when disco was king. However, by the end of the 20th century, the area had become known for higher crime rates, drugs, and prostitution, and for hostesses, strippers, and sex workers from all continents save Antarctica and many countries. Roppongi Hills (illustrated) and Tokyo Midtown are examples of large redevelopment projects that are intended to usher in a cleaned-up version of internationalization in the city.

**Coping with Vulnerabilities to Multiple Stressors in Chiapas, Mexico (Hamil Pearsall)**

This project examines whether the dual processes of globalization and climatic variability lead to diversification of agricultural coping strategies or transformation to more diversified livelihoods through a case study of vulnerabilities in Eastern Chiapas, Mexico. Chiapanecos have experienced multiple stressors over the past years, including more frequent and increased periods of drought, hurricanes, and landslides, unsustainable agricultural practices, and dramatic population growth.

## Sustainability

Sustainability research invokes questions across a multitude of spatial scales and is deeply interrelated with the department’s social justice, globalization and geographic methods themes. Our work focuses on local quality-of-life and justice issues within larger political, social and economic contexts. Current research foci include urban food systems, sprawled development patterns, land use/land cover analysis, urban ecology, environmental justice, public health outcomes, and comparative dimensions of environmental sustainability at the national and global scales. Many students interested in sustainability pursue a major in Environmental Studies (ES), or double major in ES and GUS.

### Research Projects

**Evaluating Collaborative Land Use Projects (Rob Mason)**

Rob Mason’s book, _Collaborative Land Use Management: The Quieter Revolution in Place-Based Planning_, proposed a broad framework for understanding and evaluating specific land use programs. Among the measures included in the model were ecosystem health, landscape integrity, cost effectiveness, social justice, carbon impacts and vulnerability management. Following on the book’s discussion of these evaluative dimensions—and their relevance to case studies ranging over multiple and overlapping spatial scales—will be refinement of the model and application to specific programs.

**Relationships between Community Planning, Environmental Management, and Information Technology (Michele Masucci)**

Previous research by Michele Masucci examined the relationships between community planning, environmental management and information uses and technologies in non-governmental organizations in the Atlantic Rainforest Region of Brazil, in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) River Basin region, and in Philadelphia. Professor Masucci developed an appropriate technology GIS that analyzed drought and flood data for the ACF River Basin that permitted an analysis of the relationship between information resources and drought contingency planning during a period of extreme fluctuation in drought and flood conditions during the 1980s and 1990s in the southeastern US. The outcomes of this study were the focus of a book (co-authored with Richard Perritt) entitled _Human Environmental Interchange: Managing the Effects of Recent Droughts in the Southeastern U.S_.

**Environmental Justice of Urban Air Pollution (Jeremy Mennis)**

Environmental justice is the principle that all people have equal protection under environmental laws and the right to participate in environmental decision-making in their community. I am interested in the quantitative analysis of race, class and other socioeconomic characteristics as they relate to indicators of environmental risk, particularly toxins produced from industrial and commercial activity. Recent research has focused on the distribution of air toxic releases in New Jersey, as well as on racial equity in actions taken by agencies responsible for enforcing environmental policies. For more information, visit the [research project website](https://astro.temple.edu/~jmennis/research/ej/index.htm).

**Urban Agriculture in Philadelphia (Hamil Pearsall)**

This project examines urban agriculture in Philadelphia and questions the role of sustainability initiatives in this post-industrial city’s quest to reinvent itself as an economically competitive city. Urban agriculture has become a symbol of Philadelphia’s economic revitalization, sustainability, and increasingly, its gentrification. Through archival research, a media content analysis, and interviews with urban farmers, gardeners and city officials, this research examines urban agriculture’s role in Philadelphia’s transition to economic and environmental sustainability.

**Planning and Politics of Urban Sustainability: From Metropolitan Governance to Green Infrastructure (Christina Rosan)**

Christina Rosan’s research focuses on the politics and policy of urban sustainability planning. She is interested in how we manage our cities and metropolitan areas and the role that institutions play in mediating the transition to sustainability. She has researched metropolitan governance and land use planning, urban greening, environmental justice and urban sustainability planning. Rosan is currently a part of an EPA STAR grant researching community engagement in monitoring of green infrastructure.

**Elephants, Mobility and Conservation in Southeast Asia (Jacob Shell)**

Trained elephants are used for a wide array of functions in Southeast Asia: for tourism, for religious festivals, for logging and for off-road, cross-border and flood-time transportation. Focusing on case-studies in Myanmar (Burma), this research project seeks to evaluate the potential advantages of elephant domestication, especially from a conservation standpoint. As Southeast Asia rapidly urbanizes, how are elephant-training and elephant-riding cultures and skills adapting or becoming eroded? What possibilities for human-elephant relations and mobilities might be imagined going forward?

## Geographic Methods

Among the most important new methods of the last two decades is geographical analysis. Departmental research addresses a wide range of quantitative, qualitative and representational approaches, relying heavily on spatial analytics and information technologies, including GIS and environmental remote sensing. Many of our research projects also incorporate qualitative methods, community-based research, and policy analysis.

### Research Projects

**bITS: Building Information Technology Skills in North Philadelphia (Michele Masucci)**

Building Information Technology Skills (bITS) among North Philadelphia Youth is a project funded by the National Science Foundation, ITEST Program. It involves the participation of approximately ninety high school students per year over a three-year long program. The research objective of bITS is to assess the viability of a collaborative model for developing a community geographic information system that draws on the perspectives and experiences of program participants. For more information, visit the [research project website](https://astro.temple.edu/~masucci/bits/).

**Dasymetric Mapping (Jeremy Mennis)**

The process of dasymetric mapping is the transformation of data from a set of arbitrary source zones to a dasymetric map via the overlay of the source zones with an ancillary data set.  Dasymetric mapping is applicable to a wide variety of tasks where the user seeks to refine spatially aggregated data, for example in estimating local population characteristics in areas where only coarser, regional resolution census data are available. For more information, visit the [research project website](https://astro.temple.edu/~jmennis/research/dasymetric/index.htm).

**Mapping the Presentation of World Geographies in Written Texts (Jacob Shell)**

This project geovisualizes the treatment of world geography and geographical systems and processes in numerous influential written texts on history, philosophy and political economy. So far I’ve found works by such authors as Fernand Braudel, Karl Marx, Karl Wittfogel, Peter Linebaugh, and Marcus Rediker to be especially conducive to this cartographic approach to comparative textual analysis.

**Neighborhood Effects on Treatment Continuity (Jerry Stahler)**

Local geography and the community context of where a patient resides may have an effect on client behaviors that relate to substance abuse treatment outcomes, such as relapse and attrition. The present study uses GIS and spatial analysis to examine the interacting influences of individual, program and neighborhood factors on treatment compliance and continuity for patients who have a substance use dependency as well as a co-occurring mental health disorder.
