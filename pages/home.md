## Philadelphia is Your Classroom
Welcome to the Department of Geography and Urban Studies. Geography is the study of the interaction of people, places and the environment. Urban Studies is the examination of metropolitan life, processes and problems. Our students are equipped to understand and address a wide range of environmental, economic, social and political challenges that are central to the well-being of billions of people in an urbanizing world. Through interdisciplinary coursework, the Department of Geography and Urban Studies combines strong social science skills with technical training to teach students to understand and address issues in globalization, sustainability and social justice.
