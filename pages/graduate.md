## Programs of Study
Our gradutae programs in Geography and Urban Studies focus on the themes of globalization, sustainability, social justice and geographic methiods including:
- GIS
- Remote Sensing
- Cartography
- Program Evaulation
- Qualitative Methods

Please visit the [Geography and Urban Studies Graduate Admissions page](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/admissions/graduate/) to learn more about graduate program requirements, dates and deadlines and instructions on how to apply.

## MA in Geography and Urban Studies
Graduate students in Geography and Urban Studies emphasize research in environmental issues, gender and race, geographic methods, international development, social and spatial theory and urban development. The MA degree is designed to prepare students for further graduate study as well as for professional positions related to urban and economic development, environmental sustainability and social justice. Students in the MA have the option to pursue a Graduate Certificate in GIS with no additional coursework.

## PhD in Geography and Urban Studies
The PhD in Geography and Urban Studies program trains doctoral-level students with spatially integrative frameworks and equips them with specialized skills to pursue cutting-edge research and address real-world conditions. The PhD program prepares students for faculty positions in many academic disciplines and to work in programs and departments that range from traditional geography to more interdisciplinary ones like development studies and urban planning. PhD graduates also serve research-oriented organizations that include non-governmental organizations, policy institutes and think tanks as applied researchers and administrators.

## PSM in GIS
[GIS is one of the 10 most employable skills of 2017 on LinkedIn](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/2017s-most-in-demand-skills-according-to-linkedin?utm_content=buffer23af8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer), and the [U.S. Department of Labor estimates that the geospatial technology market is growing at an annual rate of 35 percent](https://www.doleta.gov/brg/indprof/geospatial_profile.cfm). Full-time students can complete our Professional Science Master’s (PSM) degree in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in as soon as a year. This means you can return or enter the workforce quickly. We produce competitive and skilled GIS technicians who easily pass the GISP certification exam. We are affiliated with the National Professional Science Master’s Association and work with an advisory board of professionals in the field ensures that we teach the skills employers seek.

## Graduate Certificate in GIS
We offer a Graduate Certificate for students who already have a BA and want to pursue additional coursework in GIS. Our courses introduce students to a variety of cutting-edge spatial analysis technology and mapping software. The certificate complements our Professional Science Master’s in GIS and serves as a gateway into the program. It also augments graduate programs in the College of Liberal Arts and throughout Temple University.

## Funding for Graduate School
At Temple, we believe that students from all walks of life should have access to an outstanding college education. If you need help paying for graduate school, you aren’t alone. Most students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. Graduate students are eligible for financial assistance from federal, state, private and university sources. Explore all available funding and apply early to make your college education an affordable experience.

Financial aid is awarded on PhD students on academic merit. The department nominates our strongest candidates for Graduate School Fellowships, and offers a limited amount of TA-ships. Students from underrepresented groups may also be nominated for Future Faculty Fellowships. Due to limited resources, the department is not able to provide funding to all students, although the majority receive some funding eventually. MA students are not eligible for financial aid from the department.
