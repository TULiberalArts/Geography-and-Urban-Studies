## Earn an MA or PhD in Geography and Urban Studies
Our MA and PhD programs in Geography and Urban Studies focus on the themes of globalization, sustainability and social justice - three central areas to understanding and tackling the real-world conditions of an increasingly urbanized world. Philadelphia is an excellent setting that provides graduate students with opportunities to engage first-hand in public policy and urban research. Our faculty members hold doctoral degrees in a half-dozen different social sciences. In addition to the expertise of GUS faculty, we draw on the proficiencies of related programs across Temple University. 

In recent years, members of the department have published a half dozen books with leading publishers including Oxford University Press, MIT Press, and Wiley and Routledge. We've contributed articles to leading journals like the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Environment and Planning A and the Journal of Urban Affairs. In addition, our programs have won competitive grants from the World Bank, Environmental Protection Agency, United Nations, National Science Foundation and more. We are affiliated and  with the Association of American Geographers and the Urban Affairs Association. 

### MA in Geography and Urban Studies
The MA in Geography and Urban Studies program emphasizes research in environmental issues, gender and race, geographic methods, international development, social and spatial theory and urban development. Graduates from our MA program are prepared for further graduate study and for careers in academia, community organizing, economic development, environmental management, geographic systems management and planning and public administration. We place emphasis on the development of research techniques and analytical skills applicable to problem solving throughout the program.

## PhD in Geography and Urban Studies
The PhD in Geography and Urban Studies program trains doctoral-level students with spatially integrative frameworks - students in our department are equipped with specialized skills to pursue cutting-edge research and address real-world conditions. Graduates from the PhD program are prepared for faculty positions in many academic disciplines; you may work in programs and departments that range from traditional geography to more interdisciplinary ones like development studies and urban planning. You might also find relevant work in NGOs, private sector firms and relevant think tanks. Both MA and PhD students draw on our faculty's connections to community-based organizations, educational institutions, non-governmental organizations, and public agencies, as well as their work in social movements in the local region, many other regions in the United States, and international locations.

## PSM in GIS
GIS is included amongst the 10 most employable skills of 2017 on LinkedIn, and the U.S. Department of Labor estimates that the geospatial technology market is growing at an annual rate of 35 percent. Full-time students can complete our Professional Science Master’s (PSM) degree in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in as soon as a year. This means you can return or enter the workforce quickly. We produce competitive and skilled GIS technicians who easily pass the GISP certification exam. We are affiliated with the National Professional Science Master’s Association and work with an advisory board of professionals in the field to ensure that we teach the skills employers seek.

## Graduate Certificate in GIS
We offer a Graduate Certificate for students who already have a BA and want to pursue additional coursework in GIS. Our courses introduce students to a variety of cutting-edge spatial analysis technology and mapping software. The certificate complements our Professional Science Master’s in GIS and serves as a gateway into the program. It also augments graduate programs in the College of Liberal Arts and throughout Temple University.

## Academic Advising and Professional Development
As a student working toward your MA or PhD, you are guided toward a concentration based on what you want to research and the available resources at the department. The Graduate Director assigns each incoming graduate student to an initial advisor, based on area of interest. Graduate students are evaluated in an annual review process, and also at the end-of-the-first-semester to make sure you are making good progress. Currently, the department’s Graduate Director is Professor Hamil Pearsall, who can be contacted at [hamil.pearsall@temple.edu](mailto:hamil.pearsall@temple.edu). In terms of internships, we help graduate students find placements at urban planning and social service agencies that specialize in mapping and geographic data analysis. Internships are complemented by a seminar in which you discuss your experience. Currently, our internship coordinator is [Dr. Max Andrucki](mailto:max.andrucki@temple.edu).

## Funding for Graduate School
At Temple, we believe that students from all walks of life should have access to an outstanding college education. If you need help paying for graduate school, you aren’t alone. Most students receive some form of financial aid to fund their education. Graduate students are eligible for financial assistance from federal, state, private and university sources. Explore all of available opportunities and apply early to make your education an affordable experience.

PhD students are awarded financial aid on academic merit. The department nominates our strongest candidates for Graduate School Fellowships, and offers a limited amount of TA-ships. Students from underrepresented groups may also be nominated for Future Faculty Fellowships. Due to limited resources, the department is not able to provide funding to all students, although the majority receive some funding eventually. MA students are not eligible for financial aid from the department.
