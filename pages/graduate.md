## PSM in GIS
GIS is one of the 10 most employable skills of 2017 on [LinkedIn](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/2017s-most-in-demand-skills-according-to-linkedin?utm_content=buffer23af8&utm_medium=social&utm_source=facebook.com&utm_campaign=buffer), and the [U.S. Department of Labor](https://www.doleta.gov/brg/indprof/geospatial_profile.cfm) estimates that the geospatial technology market is growing at an annual rate of 35 percent. Full-time students can complete our Professional Science Master’s (PSM) degree in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in as soon as a year. This means you can return or enter the workforce quickly. We produce competitive and skilled GIS technicians who easily pass the GISP certification exam. We are affiliated with the National Professional Science Master’s Association and work with an advisory board of professionals in the field ensures that we teach the skills employers seek.
