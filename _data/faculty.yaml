  expertise: "Urban Geography; Feminist Geography; Feminist Theory; Critical Race Theory; Urban Social Theory; Social Action Research; Urban Labor Markets; Urban Poverty; Societal Dimensions of Information and Communication Technologies; and Social Movements."
  bio: "My research interests are in areas of urban geography, feminist and critical race studies, and social action research. I have approached these broad and interconnected fields through theoretically informed, empirical research examining how urban and economic processes construct, and are constructed by relations of power and inequality. I am particularly interested in the barriers that poor women of various ethnic/”racial” groups experience, and the individual and collective survival strategies that they employ, in attempting to support themselves and their families. And, because I am interested in social change, and the role of academics and research in this process, she has utilized social action research as part of a broader feminist methodology. My primary research contributions have been to offer alternative theoretical and methodological approaches to study the intersection of gender, racism, and space to further our understanding of labor markets, urban poverty, community organizing and digital inequalities. My current research examines the relationships among access to information and communication technology (ICT), poor women’s economic opportunities, and poor people’s community-based organizing from a feminist geographical perspective. This research focuses on the relationships among access to information and communication technologies (ICTs); economic, educational, and health disparities; and poor people’s community-based organizing in the United States. My research has been supported by the Fulbright Commission, the National Science Foundation, and the Social Science Research Council. My research has been published in journals such as the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, the Professional Geographer, Urban Geography, Geoforum, Transactions in GIS, and Information, Communication & Society. I received my PhD (1994) and MA (1991) from the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University and a MA (1988) in Urban and Regional Studies from the University of Sussex. I currently serve as Chair of the Department of Geography and Urban Studies and Director of the Greater Philadelphia Women’s Studies Consortium. I am serving a term as Treasurer and National Councillor of the Association of American Geographers and serve on the editorial boards of Urban Geography and Geographical Review. I have served as president of the Geographical Perspectives on Women Specialty Group of the Association of American Geographers and received the 2011 Jan Monk Service Award for contributions to the advancement of women and feminist geography in the discipline and the broader public. I have also worked with a number of community organizations related to economic empowerment and digital inequalities. I am currently Vice President of the Board of Directors of the Lower Merion School District in suburban Philadelphia and a former member of the Montgomery County Planning Commission Board in Pennsylvania."

  expertise: "Social and cultural geography, Migration, Whiteness, South Africa, Gender, sexuality and space"
  bio: "I am a broadly-trained human geographer primarily interested in social and cultural geography, particularly questions around the ways that different kinds of bodies move through and experience space. I received a BA in East Asian Languages and Cultures from Columbia University, an MA in Geography from the University of Vermont, and a Ph.D in Geography (2011) from the University of Leeds in the UK. My research and publications to date have focused on sexuality, gender, and space; the geographies of whiteness in contemporary South Africa; and on the intersection between migration, transnationalism, and identity. I am in the midst of participatory research project on transgendered people’s experiences of home-making and domestic objects as well as an ongoing project with Jen Dickinson at the University of Winchester examining shifting identities of mid-twentieth-century British migrants, settlers, and ex-pats in East and Southern Africa."

  bio:"Bradley is a professor of geography, a DJ, an accomplished yogi, a black belt in Taekwondo, and a generally complex human being. He comes from a working class Jewish background and has been heavily influenced by anti-racist and feminist traditions in music and literature. His biography has greatly influenced his research interests. His primary research pertains to Jewish migration within the Bronx. He focuses on the same neighborhoods his parents and grandparents once lived in half a century ago. Bradley’s understanding of this process is influenced by critical race theory, feminist epistemology, and the socio-spatial dialectic. Generally, Bradley’s research addresses how racism is articulated and reproduced on several geographical scales. More specifically, he examines this process by looking at the intersections between space, race, and identity. He is also very interested in the relationship between repression and resistance. His research identifies how racialized groups negotiate and fight against racist institutions and practices. He is also interested in the geographies of sport. Some of his recent research focuses on labor mobility in professional wrestling during the mid-twentieth century."

  expertise: "India, Urbanization, Economic Geography, Inequality, Development, Epistemology"
  bio: "Professor Chakravorty’s research has focused on two broad themes—empirical work on India and theoretical work on distribution and (now) epistemology.  His most recent published book is The Price of Land (2013), which is an analysis of land acquisition and conflicts in the framework of state policies and land markets in India. It was shortlisted for the 2013 Crossword Award for Non-Fiction.  Other relevant books include Fragments of Inequality (2007), which analyzes structure and change in income distributions, and Made in India (2006), which is a study of the economic geography of Indian industry.  His shorter pieces include over fifty journal papers, book chapters, and reports. The papers are scattered through journals in geography, development economics, planning, and urban studies.  He also writes occasional pieces for newspapers in India in English and Bangla. His research has been funded by the U.S. National Science Foundation, the U.S. National Institute of Justice, the American Institute of Indian Studies, and the World Bank. Right now, Professor Chakravorty has three projects at different stages of progress.  One is his first work of fiction, “The Promoter”, a satire set in contemporary Calcutta. It should be in print in 2015 summer.  The second is a book on epistemology and the archaeology of knowledge, provisionally titled “The Truth About Us: India Invented, India Unknown,” and is forthcoming from Hachette in 2016.  The third is a collaborative book (with Devesh Kapur and Nirvikar Singh) titled “The Other One Percent: Indians in America.” It is complete and under review.  He is also working with colleagues at the Center for the Advanced Study of India at the University of Pennsylvania (where he is Visiting Fellow), focusing on a survey-based project in Delhi and Mumbai. Professor Chakravorty was department chair from 2005-10, a period during which the department got its doctoral program and a new major in Environmental Studies."

  bio: "In 1972, Roman Cybriwsky made a call from a pay phone in University Park, PA where he was finishing his PhD at Penn State in Geography, and was so convincing that he was instantly offered a job teaching urban geography courses at Temple. Now, 44 years later, he still has that job, meaning that (1) he had found his niche early on, and (2) that he knew how to carve a niche. Over the years, he taught as well at the University of Victoria and the University of British Columbia in Canada, was a Senior Researcher on a 3-year urban research project at the University of Pennsylvania, and was privileged to be a Visiting Scholar at the Center of Advanced Studies at the National University of Singapore. In 1984 he became one of the first Temple faculty to teach at the Temple University Japan campus in Tokyo. He has since returned there again and to teach and conduct research, and has spent about 10 years total in Tokyo. For a contrasting experience at a Japanese institution, he taught geography courses for a semester at Hitotsubashi University. For almost six years until the end of 2006 he was Associate Dean at TUJ. His years in Japan resulted in several books. After returning to main campus, Roman Cybriwsky turned his attentions to Ukraine and its capital city, Kyiv. In 2010-2011 he was Fulbright Scholar at the prestigious and historic National University of Kyiv Mohyla Academy, where he taught urban sociology and conducted research that produced a 2014 book about Kyiv. His first appointment was in the Department of Geography at Temple, and then in Urban Studies, where he became Director and was one of the central characters in effecting the merger that created the Department of Geography and Urban Studies. For six years in the 1990s, he was Department Chair. In between returning from TUJ and going for research to Kyiv, he was Director of Asian Studies at Temple. His teaching and research focuses on contemporary cities around the world. In the early part of his career, he wrote primarily about Philadelphia, especially the early years of gentrification and accompanying social tensions, and then in turn about Vancouver, Singapore, Batam (an urbanizing, global-economy Indonesian island within sight of Singapore), Tokyo, and Kyiv. The Tokyo and Kyiv experiences have been especially productive in terms of books. He continues with research in Ukraine. His most recent book will be published soon: it is a comprehensive study of the Dnipro, the important river that flows through the heart of the country. When he was younger, Roman Cybriwsky ran one marathon after the other and used to sneak home early whenever he could to train. Now that he is older and cuts a much larger presence, he stays out late at night to walk in circles around 8- and 9-foot tables to shoot a pretty good game of pool."

  bio: "I am an Assistant Professor of Instruction in Temple University’s Department of Geography & Urban Studies, and the Assistant Director of the Professional Science Master’s in Geographic Information Systems, where I coordinate curriculum, advise students, and teach introductory and advanced courses in GIS. I worked as a database and software developer for 11 years before beginning graduate studies in GIS and geography. My research is broadly concerned with applying geospatial technologies to urban and demographic analysis. My teaching and research heavily emphasize the use of free and open source software. Technological projects in spatial database design and geovisualization are motivated by my use of demographic and economic data to address substantive questions in residential location, sprawl, spatial inequality, racial segregation, and spatial justice. My research investigates the Tiebout model, the theory that households will “vote with their feet” to move to the local government that best matches their preferences for local public services. In published research I have shown that in areas with incongruent school and municipal boundaries, municipalities are stronger “containers” for income segregation than school districts. I am extending this into an investigation of differences in segregation and inequality between regions where municipal and school district borders are congruent and those where they are not. A recent project investigates scale and spatiality in measures of segregation. Segregation measures are heavily influenced by the shapes and sizes of the population enumeration units. While segregation is an inherently spatial phenomenon, commonly used segregation measures such as the index of dissimilarity are oddly aspatial. In response, geographers have proposed spatially adjusted local and global measures of segregation. My research continues in this vein. Overall my teaching, research, and outreach are motivated by a deep love of cities, and an interest in all aspects of their functioning. I am lucky to be working in an era where access to data is increasingly open. I support the use of open data to increase civic engagement including crucial citizen interventions in urban planning and policy. I am active in local technology organizations, and invite inquiries from community and civic groups interested in learning how to apply open data and free software to their questions and needs."

  bio: "I am currently an assistant professor in the Department of Geography and Urban Studies at Temple University and a member of Fox Chase Cancer Center’s Cancer Prevention and Control program. I am a medical geographer, and my research and teaching focus on the intersection between geography, public health and epidemiology. My research focuses on describing and understanding place-based and geographic disparities in health and disease, with a specific emphasis on applied geographic methods and the role geographic factors play on cancer outcomes and prevention. I am especially interested in the interactions between socioeconomic, demographic and neighborhood environmental factors that influence human health and disease and how we can measure these factors to better understand various health outcomes. Much of the innovation in my work has been through using novel geographic methods and creating new national data sets to answer questions that are directly relevant to understanding and reducing health disparities in cancer. In the past several years, I have both led and worked with interdisciplinary teams of researchers on several high-impact projects funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), National Cancer Institute, American Cancer Society and Susan G. Komen.  Some of the findings from these studies have been published in prominent journals, and some garnered national attention and have been highlighted by the NCI and major media outlets, including the New York Times, CBS, the Guardian and Reuters.  Most recently, I received funding from the NSF Geography and Spatial Sciences Program on a project that combines approaches in geospatial methods and life course epidemiology.  I am also Co-PI on a NSF award under their new Innovations in Graduate Education track of the NSF Research Traineeship program for implementing a collaborative partnership between the Departments of Geography and Urban Studies and Biology at Temple.  My most recent publication was an article in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention that was one of the first studies to examine the role of both individual and geographic factors on human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake. I received a B.S. in Geography from Salisbury University and an M.A. in Geography from Towson University. At McGill University, I earned my Ph.D. in Geography and completed a post-doctoral fellowship in epidemiology before spending several years as a research scientist at the New Jersey Department of Health and as associate director of the New Jersey State Cancer Registry.  Prior to joining the faculty at Temple, I served on the faculty at the University of Utah (Department of Geography) and at the Rutgers University School of Public Health (Department of Epidemiology)."

  bio: "I am an Assistant Professor of Instruction in GUS/ES with research interests ranging from geohumanities to political ecology. I have a background in the political ecology of gold and diamond production in the Canadian North and the impact of early population-resource “science” on cold war geopolitics. But more recently I enjoy reading through the political fabric of science/monster fiction through the lens of psychoanalytic and topological theory. Mostly I’m interested in how science, nature and ‘the political’ are imagined and represented, either through textual or visual media, and approach the problem through a variety of contexts. I am also enthusiastic about geography education and teach Sustainable Environments, Geography of Natural Resources, and Digital Mapping."
