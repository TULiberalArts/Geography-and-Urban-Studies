### Earn an MA or PhD in Geography and Urban Studies
Our MA and PhD programs focus on the themes of globalization, sustainability and social justice - three central areas to understanding and tackling the real-world conditions of an increasingly urbanized world. The complexity of human-environment interactions, as well as the interconnectedness of the global economy have fueled a resurgence of geographic theory and methods as a framework for analyzing metropolitan and urban conditions. Temple's graduate programs in GUS draw on our Philadelphia location to provide students with opportunities to engage in public policy and urban research. 

In recent years, members of the department have published a half dozen books with leading publishers including Oxford University Press, MIT Press, and Wiley and Routledge. We've contributed articles to leading journals like the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Environment and Planning A, and the Journal of Urban Affairs. In addition, our programs have won competitive grants from the World Bank, the Environmental Protection Agency, the United Nations, the National Science Foundation, and more. Our programs are affiliated with the Association of American Geographers and the Urban Affairs Association. 

### Interdisciplinary Study
Our faculty members hold doctoral degrees in a half dozen different social sciences. Beyond the interdisciplinary expertise of the Department of Geography and Urban Studies, our program draws on the expertise of faculty in related programs across Temple University. 

### MA in Geography and Urban Studies
Graduate students in Geography and Urban Studies emphasize research in environmental issues, gender and race, geographic methods, international development, social and spatial theory and urban development. The MA degree is designed to prepare students for further graduate study as well as for professional positions related to urban and economic development, environmental sustainability and social justice. Many of our graduates continue their education by pursuing doctoral degrees in some of the nation's most prestigious PhD programs. Others find employment in public agencies and private sector firms sector agencies that deal with environmental planning, land use and urban problems.

## PhD in Geography and Urban Studies

Graduates of the program with doctorates in geography and urban studies will be able to compete for faculty positions in a range of academic departments—from departments of geography to more interdisciplinary departments and programs (focused on such fields as urban studies, urban planning, environmental studies and development studies). They will also be equipped to seek employment outside of academe. Non-governmental organizations, think tanks, research institutes, service delivery institutions, international development and economic development organizations increasingly conduct independent research and employ graduate degree holders in interdisciplinary areas like urban studies and environmental studies. 

Emphasis is placed on the development of research techniques and analytical skills applicable to problem solving. We place emphasis on the following issues:

- **Globalization:** Capital and labor flows, welfare state restructuring, identity, culture and concepts of citizenship.
- **Social Justice:** Increasing inequalities in terms of economics, gender and inequalities.
- **Sustainability:** Urban ecology, environmental justice, land use and sprawled development patterns.

## PSM in GIS

Our professional science master’s in geographic information systems (PSM in GIS) is a one-year, 30-credit professional degree designed to allow students to enter or return to the work force quickly. This program is open to all students with an interest in GIS who have already completed a bachelor's degree in any field.

Among the top 10 most employable skills of 2017 according to LinkedIn, our curriculum integrates data presentation, mobile development and statistical analysis and data mining. Our curriculum prepares students for the demands of the job market, integrating advanced technical training with business ethics and professional development. Core coursework includes spatial database design, application development, technical cartography, advanced statistics, and ethics and professional practice, culminating in a hands-on capstone experience. The program trains competitive, skilled GIS technicians and prepares students to sit for the GISP certification exam. We are affiliated with the National Professional Science Master’s Association and work with an advisory board of professionals in the field to ensure that our program is teaching the skills that employers are seeking.

For more information about the degree requirements, please visit the [graduate bulletin](http://bulletin.temple.edu/graduate/scd/cla/geographic-information-systems-psm/) or see the [PSM and graduate certificate in GIS handbook](http://www.cla.temple.edu/gus/files/2014/10/Handbook-for-PSM-and-Certificate-in-GIS-2016-2017.pdf).

## Graduate Certificate in GIS

Our graduate certificate in GIS is for students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree and would like to pursue additional GIS coursework. Faculty expertise spans a diverse array of fields, including global urban development, urban ecology and sustainability, health geography and food systems, critical approaches to nature-society relations, and theory and implementation of geographic information technologies.
