## Major in Geography and Urban Studies

In addition, you will learn qualitative and quantitative social science research methods. In required courses and electives, students examine urban issues, the role of political institutions,policy-making and human interactions with the environment. We develop each student's undergraduate program with a departmental advisor - your individual interests are factored into your academic curriculum. We also encourage our students to study abroad and intern to maximize educational and professional opportunities.

A GIS certificate will give you the skills  to take on advanced research positions in technology-based companies, governmental agencies and non-profit organizations. The GIS certificate is open to students across all colleges and schools at Temple University.
