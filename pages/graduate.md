The challenges and opportunities that face cities and metropolitan regions are central to the well-being of billions of people around the globe. Our MA and PhD programs focus on the themes of globalization, sustainability and social justice, three areas that increasingly are central to understanding such challenges and opportunities. Our professional science master's in GIS focuses on our fourth theme of geographic methods as well as professional development. We also offer a graduate certificate in GIS for students who have already completed a bachelor’s degree and would like to pursue additional GIS coursework.

## Graduate Programs in Geography and Urban Studies

- [PhD in Geography and Urban Studies](#phd-in-geography-and-urban-studies)
- [MA in Geography and Urban Studies](#ma-in-geography-and-urban-studies)
- [Professional Science Master’s in Geographic Information Systems](#psm-in-gis) (PSM in GIS)
- [Graduate Certificate in Geographic Information Systems](#graduate-certificate-in-gis) (GIS)

## PhD in Geography and Urban Studies

The complexity and pace of economic, environmental, and social change require that students are trained in interdisciplinary and spatially integrative analytical frameworks and specialized skills to apply to real-world conditions. As an integrative graduate program, the curriculum connects these processes, giving students strong analytical foundation that stresses spatial relations, scale transitions, place and context, and nature-societal relations.

The PhD program admits students holding a bachelor's or master's degree in a related social science. To fulfill the degree requirements, students must complete coursework, pass a comprehensive examination, submit a thesis proposal, and then write and defend that thesis. 

The program draws upon the interdisciplinary expertise of faculty in the Department of Geography and Urban Studies. Students will engage in research and scholarly activity with scholars who are active in helping to build multiple social science disciplines. In recent years, members of the department have published a half dozen books with leading publishers in the field including Oxford University Press, MIT Press, and Wiley and Routledge; contributed articles to leading journals like the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Environment and Planning A, and the Journal of Urban Affairs, etc., and won competitive grants from the World Bank, the Environmental Protection Agency, the United Nations, the United States Information Agency, The National Science Foundation, the Overseas Development Institute, the Inter-American Foundation, the American Institute of Indian Studies and the Economic Development Agency.

Graduates of the program with doctorates in geography and urban studies will be able to compete for faculty positions in a range of academic departments—from departments of geography to more interdisciplinary departments and programs (focused on such fields as urban studies, urban planning, environmental studies and development studies). They will also be equipped to seek employment outside of academe. Non-governmental organizations, think tanks, research institutes, service delivery institutions, international development and economic development organizations increasingly conduct independent research and employ graduate degree holders in interdisciplinary areas like urban studies and environmental studies.

To learn more about our policies, courses, and expectations, please review our [handbook](https://liberalarts.temple.edu/sites/liberalarts/files/GUSgraduatehandbook2017-2018.pdf).

## MA in Geography and Urban Studies

The MA degree is designed to prepare students for further graduate study as well as professional positions related to urban and economic development, environmental sustainability and social justice, including local and governmental agencies, non-governmental organizations at the local and international scale, community-based and public interest organizations and business.

The complexity of human-environment interactions, as well as the interconnectedness of the global economy, culture and politics, have fueled a resurgence of geographic theory and methods as a framework for analyzing metropolitan and urban conditions. The MA program encourages (although it does not absolutely require) students to develop familiarity with GIS as a research tool. By bringing together a wide range of geographic data at varying spatial scales for representation and analysis, GIS permits a simultaneous view of the human and environmental dimensions of urbanization.

Our faculty excels at theoretical and applied analysis of metropolitan areas within their broader regional, national and global contexts, often using the complex Philadelphia metropolitan region as a laboratory. We draw upon our Philadelphia location to provide students with opportunities to engage in public policy and applied urban and environmental research. Students can use our faculty’s linkages with public agencies, educational institutions, community-based organizations, non-governmental organizations and social movements in our region to deepen their knowledge of urban dynamics.

### Culminating exercise in the MA program:

In their final semester, students select a paper that they had previously written for a graduate level course. Students must enroll in GUS 9991, a course in which they work to revise and expand their selected paper. The students meet as a class to facilitate their projects. In the course of writing the master's research paper students gain experience in writing to a professional standard, using the commonly accepted conventions of the field.

## PSM in GIS

Our professional science master’s in geographic information systems (PSM in GIS) is a one-year, 30-credit professional degree designed to allow students to enter or return to the work force quickly. This program is open to all students with an interest in GIS who have already completed a bachelor's degree in any field.

Among the top 10 most employable skills of 2017 according to LinkedIn, our curriculum integrates data presentation, mobile development and statistical analysis and data mining. Our curriculum prepares students for the demands of the job market, integrating advanced technical training with business ethics and professional development. Core coursework includes spatial database design, application development, technical cartography, advanced statistics, and ethics and professional practice, culminating in a hands-on capstone experience. The program trains competitive, skilled GIS technicians and prepares students to sit for the GISP certification exam. We are affiliated with the National Professional Science Master’s Association and work with an advisory board of professionals in the field to ensure that our program is teaching the skills that employers are seeking.

## Harris Webber Graduate Fellowship

### About the Fellowship

The Harris Webber Graduate Fellowship is made possible by the generosity of Temple alumnus Harris Webber (CLA ’65). The endowment established by Mr. Webber, supplemented by funds from the College of Liberal Arts, provides financial support for an advanced PhD candidate in geography and urban studies to pursue urban research that is applied, requires fieldwork and/or has policy implications.

Mr. Webber is the founder of Harris Webber Ltd, a company involved in the planning, architecture, development and management of retirement communities and health care facilities.  This endowed fellowship expresses his commitment to the importance of preparing researchers to understand and shape livable, sustainable, socially productive and more equitable metropolitan communities of the future.  That commitment marks his entire professional career as a community planner in many different settings.

## Harris Webber Graduate Fellowship Recipients

**2016-2017: Sarah Stinard-Kiel and Yoonhee Jung, PhD candidates in Geography and Urban Studies**

Stinard-Kiel’s research will look at a new shift in social services toward ‘trauma-informed care.’ She will be looking at how trauma-informed approaches have been gaining traction over the past decade, particularly when it comes to service provisions for youth in disadvantaged urban areas. Her research will examine how practices and discourses around trauma are being deployed by social workers, schools and government agencies and what kind of broader structural and political impacts they may be having. The research will involve ethnographic fieldwork in Philadelphia and New Orleans to examine how trauma-approaches play out in these two urban contexts. The results of the research will be shared with social service organizations and are likely to impact the future of trauma-informed urban policy.

Jung’s research will examine how urban sustainability is defined, conceptualized and translated into practice in Seoul, one of the Asian megacities, by observing the processes of the decision-making and practices of two major urban policy, focusing on sustainable urban form and public space. Her research questions center on decision-making processes for urban sustainability policy, asking what factors were crucial for the discourse around urban environmental policy decision-making in Seoul. A mixed method including in-depth interviews and spatial analysis will be used for this research. By examining urban sustainability issues in Asian megacity context, this study will contribute to the development of urban theory on the definition and conceptualization of urban sustainability by adding new perspective from Asian megacities in the current west-oriented literature on urban sustainability. Also, this study will provide a valuable case study of the processes and the effects of urban environmental policy practice for other Asian megacities.

**2015-2016: Ritwika Biswas, PhD candidate in Geography and Urban Studies**

Biswas’ research examines the factors that restrict or enhance Indian women’s access to urban spaces and their mobility and therefore their ability to exercise their rights of full citizenship. By examining the issue from a feminist geographic perspective, the research aims to move beyond a focus on fear of crime as limiting women’s mobility to analyze the interconnectedness among various socio-cultural gendered norms, and urban policies and planning that hinder or support women’s mobility. Drawing on qualitative methodology and mapping, the study will take place in the metropolitan city of Kolkata involving women and men aged 18 to 65. The results of the proposed research will likely make important contributions to Indian urban policies and academic debates.

**2014-2015: Colleen Hammelman, PhD candidate in Geography and Urban Studies.**

Hammelman’s research examines the coping strategies employed by displaced women in Medellin, Columbia and Latina migrant domestic workers in Washington DC in order to better understand both everyday lived experiences of food insecurity in these environments and the influence of structural processes. Her research questions center on connectivity, asking how food insecurity coping strategies carried out by transnational migrants relate to the connectivity fostered by mobility and social networks. Using a mixed methods research design characterized by the qualitative GIS method of sketch-mapping during in-depth interviews, she asks how food insecurity coping strategies relate to neighborhood and city-wide mobility/immobility, how social networks influence food insecurity coping strategies, and how mobility and social networks support or affect each other.
