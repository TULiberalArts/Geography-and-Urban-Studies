### Earn an MA or PhD in Geography and Urban Studies
Our MA and PhD programs focus on the themes of globalization, sustainability and social justice - three central areas to understanding and tackling the real-world conditions of an increasingly urbanized world. The complexity of human-environment interactions, as well as the interconnectedness of the global economy have fueled a resurgence of geographic theory and methods as a framework for analyzing metropolitan and urban conditions. Temple's graduate programs in GUS draw on our Philadelphia location to provide students with opportunities to engage in public policy and urban research. 

In recent years, members of the department have published a half dozen books with leading publishers including Oxford University Press, MIT Press, and Wiley and Routledge. We've contributed articles to leading journals like the Annals of the Association of American Geographers, Environment and Planning A, and the Journal of Urban Affairs. In addition, our programs have won competitive grants from the World Bank, the Environmental Protection Agency, the United Nations, the National Science Foundation, and more. Our programs are affiliated with the Association of American Geographers and the Urban Affairs Association.

### MA in Geography and Urban Studies
Graduate students in Geography and Urban Studies emphasize research in environmental issues, gender and race, geographic methods, international development, social and spatial theory and urban development. The MA degree is designed to prepare students for further graduate study as well as for professional positions related to urban and economic development, environmental sustainability and social justice. Many of our graduates continue their education by pursuing doctoral degrees in some of the nation's most prestigious PhD programs. Others find employment in public agencies and private sector firms sector agencies that deal with environmental planning, land use and urban problems.

### PhD in Geography and Urban Studies
Graduates of our PhD program in Geography and Urban Studies are prepared for faculty positions in a range of academic disciplines; they work in programs and departments that range from traditional geography to more interdisciplinary ones like development studies and urban planning. They also are prepared for employment outside of academia, including NGOs and think tanks that deal with relevant issues. Our faculty members hold doctoral degrees in a half dozen different social sciences. Beyond the interdisciplinary expertise of the Department of Geography and Urban Studies, our program draws on the expertise of faculty in related programs across Temple University. 

We place emphasis on the following issues:

- **Globalization:** Capital and labor flows, welfare state restructuring, identity, culture and concepts of citizenship.
- **Social Justice:** Increasing inequalities in terms of economics, gender and inequalities.
- **Sustainability:** Urban ecology, environmental justice, land use and sprawled development patterns.

## PSM in GIS
Temple University offers a Professional Science Master’s (PSM) degree in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). GIS is included amongst the 10 most employable skills of 2017 on LinkedIn, and the U.S. Department of Labor estimates that the geospatial technology market is growing at an annual rate of 35 percent. If you attend full-time, you can complete the program in one year and enter or return to the workforce quickly. We produce competitive, skilled GIS technicians who are able to sit for and pass the GISP certification exam. We are affiliated with the National Professional Science Master’s Association and work with an advisory board of professionals in the field to ensure that we teach the skills employers seek.

### Graduate Certificate in GIS
If you've already completed your bachelor's degree, and you'd like to pursue additional coursework in GIS, we offer a Graduate Certificate in GIS. Geographic information is increasingly integrated into the fabric of everyday life, and the explosion of interest in GIS is fueling demand for well-trained professional practictioners. Our courses introduce students to a variety of cutting-edge spatial analysis technology and mapping software. If you choose, the certificate complements our Professional Science Master’s in GIS and serves as a gateway into the program. It also complements graduate programs in the College of Liberal Arts and throughout Temple University.

### Academic Advising
As a student working toward your MA or PhD, you’ll be guided toward a concentration based on your interests and the available resources at the department.

### Financial Aid and Scholarships for Graduate School
Graduate students are eligible for financial assistance from federal, state, private and Temple University sources. The FAFSA, or Free Application for Federal Student Aid, is the primary form that the government, states and Temple University uses to award grants, scholarships, work study and student loans. Filling out the FAFSA often results in a substantial boost in financial assistance.

Our department also offers a limited number of assistantships and merit-based scholarships for graduate students on a highly competitive basis. An assistantship provides some or all of the funding needed for grad school while you are working for Temple University in some capacity. Merit-based scholarships are awarded to students with exceptional achievements relating to African American Studies.
